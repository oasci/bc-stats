We will learn about general discrete random variables and general discrete probability distributions.
Then, we'll investigate one particular probability distribution called the hypergeometric distribution.

title: Objectives

-   To learn the formal definition of a discrete random variable.
-   To learn the formal definition of a discrete probability mass function.
-   To understand the conditions necessary for using the hypergeometric distribution.
-   To use the probability mass function of a hypergeometric random variable to find probabilities.
-   To apply the material learned in this lesson to new problems.
